Client Source Code
==================

This is where **raw** CSS and JS source code lives.

Development setup
=================

- install `node.js` and `npm`
    + example: nvm https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation
- install `yarn`: https://yarnpkg.com/ (better alternative to `npm` that is developed by Facebook)
- run: `yarn install` (install npm dependencies)

## Compile / Watch JavaScript


- run: `yarn run webpack`

- watch behaviour: every time you edit javascript files, `webpack` recompiles files
